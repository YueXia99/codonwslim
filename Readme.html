<P>CodonW is a package for codon usage analysis. It was designed to simplify
Multivariate Analysis (MVA) of codon usage. The MVA method employed in
CodonW is correspondence analysis (COA) (the most popular MVA method for
codon usage analysis). CodonW can generate a COA for codon usage, relative
synonymous codon usage or amino acid usage. Additional analyses of codon
usage include investigation of optimal codons, codon and dinucleotide bias,
and/or base composition. CodonW analyses sequences encoded by genetic codes
other than the universal code.&nbsp;

<P><U>Why call it codonW?&nbsp;</U>&nbsp;

<P>Well, "clustal" (a very popular multiple alignment program by Des Higgins)
was originally written in Paul's lab in Trinity College Dublin. Clustal
has since been rewritten from FORTRAN into C and undergone several name
changes clustal-> clustalv-> clustalw -> clustalx. There was also a program
called "codons" written in FORTRAN by <A HREF="http://acer.gen.tcd.ie/incbi/atl.html">Andrew
Lloyd</A> (another post-doc in Paul's lab), this was the original inspiration
for codonW. An early version of codonW, written in C, was called codonv.
When the code was enhanced to include multivariate analysis, what better
name than codonW&nbsp;

CodonW version 1.3 June 1997</H3>
<p>The source code for CodonW can be obtained from <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/codonw/">SourceForge</A>
. Binaries for a number of platforms are also available at this site.&nbsp;

<P><IMG SRC="bar.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=439>&nbsp;
<H3>
To Install and Build on UNIX Platforms</H3>
Get the source code from <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/codonw/">SourceForge&nbsp;</A>&nbsp;
<BR>Change directory to the directory where you intend to install CodonW.&nbsp;

<P><B><TT>uncompress codonW.tar.Z&nbsp;</TT></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B><TT>tar -xvf codonW.tar&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B><TT>cd codonw&nbsp;</TT></B>&nbsp;
<BR><TT><B>./codonWinstall all </B>(asks some questions,
then builds codonw)&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<P>This will ask a few questions regarding 'make' and 'cc' and then
configure the installation and compile the programs. If you don't understand
the questions, just accept the default by pressing the return key and the
installation should be OK using the defaults. The install script by default
also creates a number of links to the compiled executable codonW. These
links allow codonW to emulate other useful codon usage analysis and sequence
manipulation software by passing the menu interface (for more information
see <A HREF="http://codonw.sourceforge.net/ReadmeLinks.html">README.links</A>).
Alternatively you can just elect to only build the main program, and not
install the linked programs.

<P><TT><B>./codonWinstall codonw </B>(compile only)</TT>
<BR>Once you have successfully built codonw, try these commands to
get you started.

<P><TT><B>./codonw -help </B>(for commandline summary)</TT>
<BR><TT><B>./codonw</B> (menu interface)</TT>

<P>&nbsp;There is also a short<A HREF="http://codonw.sourceforge.net/Tutorial.html"> tutorial</A> available.For the most recent documentation on codonW see <A HREF="http://codonw.sourceforge.net/">http://codonw.sourceforge.net/</A>

To Set the Codonw Help Environment:&nbsp;</H4>


<P>CodonW has an in-built help system, the help file is called
codonW.hlp and should be located in the same directory as the executable
codonw. Alternatively the help file can be pointed to by the environment
variable CODONW_H, if you are using a C shell you can add something similar
to this to your .login script.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P><B>setenv CODONW_H <I>file_path</I><I>&nbsp;</I></B>

<P>Where file_path is the fully defined path name for codonW.hlp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Bugs</H3>
This is a beta version of codonW, therefore there may be bugs within
the code. If you do find or notice anything strange please e-mail bug reports/complaints/suggestions
please <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/sendmessage.php?touser=1203381">Email</A>.
Remember to include an example of the input file (and output files) and
the options selected that generated the error, don't forget to tell me
the make of computer and operating system it was running under.
